                <h2 class="subtitle"><strong>4 x 4 Interval Training:</strong></h2>
                <p>Recommended by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, the 4 x 4 Interval Training HIIT workout is best implemented on a seven-week program. This 4X4 routine requires the participant to go at high intensity for four minutes usually around 85-95 per cent of maximum heart rate, followed by three minutes of active recovery at 60 per cent of maximum heart rate. To complete the 4 x 4 interval training workout:
                    <ol type="1" id="indent">
                    <li>Warm-up (10-minute moderate jog)</li>
                    <li>Interval 1 (1-2 minute sprint at 85-95% max heart rate)</li>
                    <li>Active break (3 minutes lower intensity moderate jogging)</li>
                    <li>Cool-down (5-minute moderate jogging)</li>
                    <li>This formula could easily be replicated to incorporate any exercise, however, for this example, the base model is running.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Interval</strong>: 1-2 minutes/3 minutes rest<br>
                    <strong>Rounds</strong>: 1-3</p>

                <h2 class="subtitle"><strong>Tabata Protocol:</strong></h2>
                <p>Created by Izumi Tabata, the Tabata Protocol is one of the best workout methods to incorporate into your fitness routine. It only takes eight minutes (give or take) every three days, so this is a creating method system to add for beginners. The Tabata Protocol is best performed with  Stationary Bike, Versaclimber, Rowing Machine, Elliptical Trainer or another piece of cardio equipment that allows for gradually increasing resistance, speed and utilises the large muscles of your legs. To complete a Tabata Protocol HIIT workout:

                    <ol type="1" id="indent">
                            <li>Warm-up for 2 minutes at a moderate pace, before initiating 2 intervals.</li>
                            <li>First, increase the tension one notch above where your warmup ended.</li>
                            <li>Pedal at 100 per cent effort for 20 seconds.</li>
                            <li>Pedal slow for the next 10 seconds as a recovery. If you are wearing a heart rate monitor, you will see your Heart Rate go up after you stop pedalling. This is because of the Oxygen Debt created signals your body to get more oxygen to your energy system.</li>
                            <li>Repeat the full process 1 more time.</li>
                            <li>After 2 intervals, decrease the tension to 0 and pedal slow for 2 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Do this workout three times per week â€“ allow yourself at least one full day of recovery between workouts. Your body needs to heal itself, increase the strength of your heart and lungs, etc.</li>
                    </ol><br>
                    <strong>Interval</strong>: 20 seconds/10 seconds rest<br>
