                <strong>Nutrition:</strong> 450 calories, 13 g fat (5 g saturated fat), 563 mg sodium, 42 g carbs (6 g fiber, 3 g sugar), 41 g protein (calculated without sour cream and with ½ cup brown rice per serving)
                What better way to eat some of our favorite protein-packed foods—black beans and grass-fed beef—than in a burrito bowl. This tortilla-less dish is not only delicious but also budget friendly. Even though grass-fed beef can be pricey, 
                this recipe doesn't only rely on the beef. That way, you can save money and be just as satisfied by the ample amount of veggies it's served with.

                Did you know that shrimp is one of the most protein-dense foods you can find? 
                Each gram of meat is made up of 25 percent protein! 
                The muscle-building fish is used in this dish, which comes together in no time. 
                Because your plate will be mostly pasta and shrimp, we'd recommend pairing it with a side salad before dinner. 
                Doing so can actually help your body control its blood glucose levels, meaning you'll not only stay fuller longer, 
                but you'll also save your body from an inflammatory spike in blood sugar.

            <h2 class="subtitle"> <strong>Shrimp Fried Quinoa</strong></h2>

            <p> <strong>Serves: 4</strong><br>
                <strong>Nutrition:</strong> 
                432 calories, 13 g fat (2 g saturated fat), 753 mg sodium, 44 g carbs, 6 g fiber, 10 g sugar, 32 g protein (calculated with low sodium soy sauce, low sodium chicken broth)
                
                Say goodbye to take-out fried rice. Whipping up this meal at home means you'll get over 30 grams of protein in under 30 minutes 
                That high protein count is all thanks to the power-couple of quinoa and shrimp. 
                If you haven't heard, quinoa is one of the few plant-based proteins that is a complete protein—meaning 
                it contains all 9 essential amino acids. One of those amino acids? L-arginine, an amino acid which has 
                been shown to preferentially promote muscle strength over fat gain. Go quinoa!
